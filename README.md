# Deep Metagenomic Binners (DMB)

This repository contains three proposed metagenomic binners. All binners utilize a joint deep clustering method, which is borrowed from Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders (DCEC, https://github.com/XifengGuo/DCEC)

The proposed binners are:
1. Deep Convolutional Metagenomic Binner (DCMB)

This binner utilizes unprocessed contigs as the only input feature.

2. Deep Stacked Metagenomic Binner (DSMB) 

This binner utilizes as input handcrafted features, namely abundance and composition.

3. Deep Variational Metagenomic Binner (DVMB)
